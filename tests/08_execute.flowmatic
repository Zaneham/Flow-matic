* TEST 08: EXECUTE - Subroutine mechanism!
* From U1518 manual: "Performs designated operation or sequence of operations"
* This is a primitive but effective subroutine call mechanism!

(0)  INPUT DATA FILE-A ; OUTPUT RESULT FILE-B .

* Main loop
(1)  READ-ITEM A ; IF END OF DATA GO TO OPERATION 6 .

(2)  TRANSFER A TO B .

* Call subroutine to process the record (operations 10-12)
(3)  EXECUTE OPERATION 10 THROUGH OPERATION 12 .

* After subroutine returns, write result
(4)  WRITE-ITEM B .

(5)  JUMP TO OPERATION 1 .

(6)  STOP .

* ============================================
* SUBROUTINE: Operations 10-12
* Double the value and add a bonus
* ============================================

(10) MULTIPLY VALUE (B) BY 2 GIVING DOUBLED (B) .

(11) ADD 10 TO DOUBLED (B) .

(12) MOVE "PROCESSED" TO STATUS (B) .
